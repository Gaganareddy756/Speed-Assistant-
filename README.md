# Speed-Assistant
This Python-based simulator mimics real-time driving conditions to support intelligent speed regulation in autonomous vehicles. It dynamically adjusts speed recommendations based on road conditions, traffic density, and legal speed limits, helping vehicles adapt safely to their environment.

ðŸš— Augmented Reality Speed Assistant (ARSA)
Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Safety through AR, IoT, NLP, and Deep RL
ARSA is an intelligent speed management system designed for autonomous vehicles. It leverages Augmented Reality, Deep Reinforcement Learning, IoT, and Natural Language Processing to create an adaptive, user-friendly environment for safer, more efficient driving.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- Minimize speed-related accidents by delivering real-time driving insights
- Enable dynamic speed optimization across diverse traffic and weather conditions
- Foster intuitive driver-vehicle interaction using voice commands and AR overlays

ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- AR overlays of speed limits, hazards, and traffic updates on HUD/glasses
- Deep RL-powered adaptive speed recommendations
- NLP-enabled voice interface for hands-free control
- IoT-based environment sensing (traffic, weather, road conditions)
- Real-time alerts and hazard detection
- Edge computing for low-latency responsiveness
